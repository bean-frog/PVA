# PVA
PVA - Personal Verbal Abuser
#### more updates for things like customizability and harshness level coming soon, this is just proof of concept
# Your very own verbal abuser, to help you study for finals or some other test because who doesnt like constantly being harassed by a robot?
# Instructions
#### Download the files in the folder corresponding to your OS (MacOS, Windows, Linux)
#### Run the setup script (.zsh, .sh, or .bat depending on os)
#### Setup script installs playsound by default. In order to have a sound play when being notified, simply download whatever sound you want, rename it to `sound.mp3` and put it in the same folder as the setup file (FEATURE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, DOES NOT DO ANYTHING YET)
#### If you select "no" when the setup script asks you to start PVA, manually start PVA when you want by running `cd ~/ *folder that contains the folder with setup and pva files, ex. Downloads*`, then `cd *name of folder containing setup and pva files*`, then running `python PVA-*your os*.py`
